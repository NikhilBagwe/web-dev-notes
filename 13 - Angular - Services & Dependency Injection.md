## Service:

- Suppose we have an SAAS application and we have provided "Subscribe" button (which calls the subscription logic and subscribes the user) in multiple components present on the page. Like in header, footer and hero-section. 
- Thus, now we would be required to write the same subscription logic multiple times for multiple components.
