## What is SPA ?

## Data Binding :

- Data binding is basically the communication between Component (.ts) and View (.html).

### 1-way Data binding :

- Used for only displaying data.
- In Angular, we use "String Interpolation" or "Interpolation" to acheive it. Here we use CURLY brackets.
- Another way is "Property Binding". Here we use SQUARE brackets in HTML attributes.
- Data goes from " Component => View " in case of Interpolation and Prop. Binding
- We use EVENT BINDING to send data from " View => Component ".

### 2-way Data binding :

- Data is shared between Comp. and View in real-time.
