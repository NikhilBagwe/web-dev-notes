## 1. Why is JS weakly/dynamically typed language ?

- We don't declare the data type while declaring variable. Thus, JS is weakly typed.
- JS dosen't run on a system like C, C++, etc. , it is built to run on the browser. So it dosen't directly interacts with the system hardware.
- JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning that variable types can change during runtime. 
- This flexibility enables JavaScript to handle a wide range of scenarios and simplifies certain programming tasks.

## 2. Why is JS single-threaded ?

- Single-threaded means code is executed line by line, one line at a time.
- Javascript is single-threaded because, originally, it was only a web browser scripting language created to serve the needs of a single user
 on a single window of the browser, eliminating the need for multithreading
 
 ## 3. What are closures and their Real use cases ?
 
 - A function having access to lexical enivironment of outer function is called a closure.
 - Use case : Fuction Currying, Tracking DOM State / Styles, Higher-Order Functions

## 4. Advantages of React over VanillaJS

- Reconcilation : the process by which React updates the UI to reflect changes in the component state
- We get pre-built features such as State management, Context API in React
- Component based architecture
