## CSS Animations :

- There are 2 ways of creating animations in CSS : Transitions and Animations.

## Transitions :

- They wait until changes in the property occurs and then allows those changes to take place over time.
- Without a transition prop, any changes in a property will take place immediately.
- Must be used when props are changed interactively by user when hovered or focused on the part of page.

## Animations :

- Provide keyframes for more control on the animation 
- Allows us to create more complex animations on a frame by frame basis.
