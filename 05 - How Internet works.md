# Basic Terminologies :

---

## Network :

- A system in which all resources/machines such as computers, printers, laptop etc. are connected is called Network.
- It can be wired or wireless.
- When you connect your mobile phone, computer, smart TV, etc. to your wifi router, it forms LAN - Local Area Network.
- When resources from different states/cities/towns are connected together and can communicate with each other, it forms MAN - Metropolitan Area N/w
- When resources from different countries are connected together and can communicate with each other, it forms WAN - Wide Area N/w

## Internet :

- The word Internet is made up of : Inter - stands for Interconnection and Net - Network.
- Internet is a global sytem where billions of devices are connected with each other.
- It is a network of networks.
- It consists of WANs, MANs and LANs connnected to each other.

## WWW :

- World Wide Web -- also known as the web, WWW or W3 -- refers to all the public websites or pages that users can access on their local computers and other devices through the internet. 
- These pages and documents are interconnected by means of hyperlinks that users click on for information.
- It is a subset of Internet.
- In url, it indicates that a given website uses HTTP to communicate.

## IP address :

- It is a unique address through which we can uniquely identify a machine connected to internet.

## Browser :

- It is a tool through which we can access the documents, websites, resources available on Internet.

## Browser engine :

- The primary job of a browser engine is to transform HTML documents and other resources of a web page into an interactive visual representation on a user's device.
- Google originally used WebKit for its Chrome browser but eventually forked it to create the Blink engine.

## Client Server Flow :

- When we send a request to 'www.fb.com', which actually is a domain name.
- To access the fb server we need IP address of it. So DNS server converts domain name to IP addr then your request goes further. This process is called DNR - Domain Name Resolution.
- On processing request, server sends a response back.

## History of Internet :

- Famous project in 1960s named ARPANET of Defense development Department.
- The objective of the project was to send data from one machine to other by breaking the data down to smaller chunks called as packets.
- In 1970s the system improved.
- In 1980s, DNS was created
- In 1990s online email, messaging, shopping was introduced.
- Year 2000 was rise was FB and mobile phones.

## How a packet travels over internet ?

- A client sends the request to the ISP. In between the request goes through multiple routers eg: wifi router.
- Router is a device used to connect multiple networks.
- Now ISP checks whether it knows the IP addr of the destination server where the request is to be sent.
- There are diff. types of ISP : Local, Regional, etc.
- Suppose if your request reaches Local ISP first and it dosen't knows the IP addr of dest. server, it forwards the req. to Regional ISP.
- If Regional ISP dosen't knows it, the req. is further sent to NSP - National Service provider.
- Then if NSP knows the IP adde. ot routes the req. accordingly to dest. server.

### NOTE : Every Router has a Routing table where it stores the IP addresses. On receiving a req. it checks whether it has the required IP and if it is present, than routes the req. to that IP. If IP is not present than it forwards the req. to it's  Parent router and so on.
